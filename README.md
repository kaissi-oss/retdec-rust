# retdec-rust

[![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/retdec/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/retdec)
[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/retdec.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/retdec)

A Rust library and tools providing easy access to the
[retdec.com](https://retdec.com) decompilation service through their public
[REST API](https://retdec.com/api/).

You can either incorporate the library in your own tools:

```rust
extern crate retdec;

use retdec::{Decompiler, DecompilationArguments, File, Settings};

let decompiler = Decompiler::new(
    Settings::new()
        .with_api_key("YOUR-API-KEY")
);
let mut decompilation = decompiler.start_decompilation(
    DecompilationArguments::new()
        .with_input_file(File::from_path("hello.exe")?)
)?;
decompilation.wait_until_finished()?;
let output_code = decompilation.get_output_hll_code()?;
print!("{}", output_code);
```

or you can use the provided tool for stand-alone decompilations:

```text
$ decompiler -k YOUR-API-KEY hello.exe
```

Either way, you get the decompiled C code:

```text
//
// This file was generated by the Retargetable Decompiler
// Website: https://retdec.com
// Copyright (c) 2017 Retargetable Decompiler <info@retdec.com>
//

int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Additionally, the crate provides access to the
[fileinfo](https://retdec.com/api/docs/fileinfo.html) service (analysis of
binary files).

## Status

The library is **at the beginning of its development** and its state is
**pre-alpha** (**highly experimental**).

A summary of the supported parts of the [retdec.com's
API](https://retdec.com/api/docs/index.html) is available
[here](https://github.com/s3rvac/retdec-rust/tree/master/STATUS.md).

## Installation

Currently, the only way of using the library and tools is to specify the
dependency from this git repository. To do that, add the following lines into
your `Cargo.toml` file:

```text
[dependencies]
retdec = { git = "https://github.com/s3rvac/retdec-rust" }
```

As soon as the first version is released, you will be able to add a dependency
directly from [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

## Documentation

An automatically generated API documentation is available here:

* [master](https://projects.petrzemek.net/retdec-rust/doc/master/retdec/index.html)

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. Notes:

* To generate API documentation, run

    ```text
    cargo doc --lib --no-deps
    ```

* To run unit tests, execute

    ```text
    cargo test --lib
    ```

* To run documentation tests, execute

    ```text
    cargo test --doc
    ```

* To run all tests, including integration tests, execute

    ```text
    RETDEC_API_KEY=YOUR-API-KEY cargo test
    ```

  *Note*: Before running integration tests, you need to set the
  `RETDEC_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key. Integrations tests
  communicate with the `retdec.com`'s API, which is why a valid API key is
  needed.
