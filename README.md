# retdec-rust

A Rust library and tools providing easy access to the
[retdec.com](https://retdec.com) decompilation service through their public
[REST API](https://retdec.com/api/).

## Status

The library is **at the beginning of its development** and its state is
**pre-alpha** (**highly experimental**).

## Installation

Currently, the only way of using the library and tools is to specify the
dependency from this git repository. To do that, add the following lines into
your `Cargo.toml` file:

```
[dependencies]
retdec = { git = "https://github.com/s3rvac/retdec-rust" }
```

As soon as the first version is released, you will be able to add a dependency
directly from [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

## Documentation

An automatically generated API documentation will be available after the first
version is released.
